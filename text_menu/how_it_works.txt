This diagram shows, for example, that uk_multiple_coin_calculator.py imports general_functions.py and is imported by main_menu.py.

====================================================


=====A user-orientated overview of how the program works======

In order to run the program, you need to run main_menu.py.
(I.e you need to type 'python text_menu/main_menu.py' into the console, provided your terminal is currently
in the folder 'Capstone-project-2')

Once the program has started, you will be presented with the main menu, which contains 6 options. Entering the
integer corresponding with each option into the console will take you to the respective part of the program. 

The 'Set details' section contains a sub menu that works similarly to the main menu. In this section, you can
change the currency between US Dollars and Pounds Sterling. You can also change the minimum and maximum amount
of coins that the program will accept from the user. Note that initially the program is set to Pounds Sterling,
with the minimum amount of coins equal to 0 and the maximum equal to 10000. The minmum is capped at 10000. You
cannot set the minimum to be higher than the current maximum or the maximum to be higher than the current
minimum (because there is no reason to do so!). 

When using 'Coin calculator' and 'Multiple coin calculator' the current settings will be taken into account. 
E.g. if you have set the currency to US Dollars, then you will presented with a calculator working in US Dollars;
if you have set the minimum amount of coins to equal 500, then you can only work with 500 or more pennies/cents.

The 'Display program configurations' section allows you to see what the current settings are. If you have not
changed any settings, then the initial settings will be displayed.

The 'Print coin list' section shows you what coins are currently in circulation within the program. If the
currency is set to Pounds Sterling, you will be shown UK coin denominations. If the currency is set to 
US Dollars, you will be shown US coin denominations. Note that apart from changing the currency, the coins
in circulation within the program cannot be changed. E.g there is no way of adding a 2p coin into 
circulation.  

======================================================

=====A programmer-orientated overview of how the program works=====

Note that the purpose of this section is to explain the relationships between all of the pages comprising the 
program, not to explain the purposes of the individual pages themselves. The latter is done in the comments of
the individual pages.

On running main_menu.py, the variable list 'config' is set to equal the constant list 'CONFIG',
the main menu is printed and the function 'option_chooser' allows the user to choose between 6 options. Choosing
options 1 or 2 at this stage will take the user to uk_coin_calculater or uk_multiple_coin_calculator 
respectively, and the minimum and maximum coin value will equal 0 and 10000 respectively.

These choices of min/max coin value, along with whether the uk or us calculators are used, are controlled by 'config'. 
The reason why the program initially works with min = 0 , max = 10000 and UK currency is because initially
config = CONFIG, where
CONFIG = {
    "currency": "POUNDS STERLING",
    "min_coin_value": 0,
    "max_coin_value": 10000,
}.
These values of config are changed using set_details.py, which the user accesses via choice 4 of the main menu, 'Set
details'. To see how set_details.py changes config read the comments in set_details.py.

Changing config will change how options 1 and 2 of the main menu work. For example, if 
config = {
    "currency": "US DOLLARS",
    "min_coin_value": 567,
    "max_coin_value": 9741,   
}
then options 1 and 2 will take the user to us_coin_calculator and us_multiple_coin_calculator respectively, and the 
minimum and maximum coin value will equal 567 and 9741 respectively. 

The result of choices 3 and 5 from main_menu.py (corresponding to 'Print coin list' and 'Display program configurations')
also depend on what config is set to. E.g 'Print coin list' shows UK coins if config["currency"] = "Pounds Sterling", but shows
US coins if config["currency"] = "US DOLLARS". 

Choosing option 6 of the main menu ends the program as it ends the while-loop in main_menu.py. Once the while-loop has ended,
the program prints "Thank you for using!" and the user is returned to the console.
